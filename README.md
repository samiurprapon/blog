# Getting Started üöÄ

## Development Environment

- node.js 14.X
- yarn 1.22.X

## Installing & Configuration

### 0. Clone this repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/samiurprapon/blog.git
```

### 1. Go into the repository

```bash
$ cd blog
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
$ yarn install
```

### 3. **Generate a Github Personal Access Token.**

Generate a Github personal access token using these [Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) or simply go and generate from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

**`Make sure you don't select any scope just generate a simple token without any scope`**

After that copy your generated token and then encode your token into base 64 using this [Website](http://www.utilities-online.info/base64/)

`Copy your base64 converted token`

### 4. **Change `/src/config.js`.**

Go to your cloned repository and make the following changes in `/src/config.js`

```javascript
const config = {
  // Github Converted Token (User, repo) from -> https://www.utilities-online.info/base64
  githubConvertedToken: "Your access token here",

  // Github UserName
  githubUserName: "Your github username here",

  // Github Repo Name
  githubRepo: "Your repo's name here",

  // Personal Blog Title
  title: "Title of your blog",

  // Personal Blog Subtitle
  subtitle: "Subtitle of your blog",
};
```

### 5. **Write A Blog.**

After doing following changes now you just need to write a blog on repository issues that you have mentioned in your `config.js`

- Open your repository [github issues](https://github.com/samiurprapon/blog/issues)
- Create a new issue with categorical labels
- Now write your blog in github issue in markdown. You can also use [slack edit](https://stackedit.io/app#) to write your markdown
- Add a label `blog` on your github issue to make it different from other standard issues. Keep in mind `blog` label is mandatory otherwise it won't show on your website.

### 6. **Deploy**

0. Build webpage

```bash
$ yarn run build
```

1. Deploy on github

```bash
$ yarn run deploy
```

2. Go to `https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>/settings/secrets/actions` , click `New repository secret` and add a secret named as `ACCESS_TOKEN` and paste your previously generated Github Personal Access Token as `value`.
3. **Change `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.**

```yml
git config --global user.email "your-github-mail-address"
git config --global user.name "your-github-username"
git remote set-url origin https://${{secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN}}@github.com/<your-github-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
```
